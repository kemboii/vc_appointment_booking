# UEAB VC Appointment Booking

A **full-stack Flutter application** built to streamline appointment booking with the Vice Chancellor at the **University of Eastern Africa, Baraton**.  
This project demonstrates my ability to design, build, and deploy a **scalable mobile app** integrated with **Firebase Authentication** and **Cloud Firestore** for secure data handling.

## Why I Built This
Universities often struggle with manual appointment booking systems that cause delays, confusion, and overlapping schedules.  
This app solves that by providing a **digital-first solution** that is simple, role-based, and enforces business rules such as **one appointment per month per user**.

## What This Project Shows About Me
- Ability to design **end-to-end systems** using **Flutter + Firebase**  
- Experience building **role-based authentication** (Student, Parent, Staff, Admin)  
- Knowledge of **scalable data models** in Firestore  
- Skills in **UI/UX** – clean, role-specific booking flows  
- Security awareness: limiting access to admins, validating roles, and secure data handling  
- Problem-solving: translating real-world university constraints into enforceable **business rules**

## Key Features
- Email/Password Authentication with Firebase  
- Role-based registration for Students, Parents, Staff, and Admins  
- Book **15-minute slots** available only on Tuesdays (9:00 AM – 12:00 PM)  
- Enforced monthly limit: one appointment per user per month  
- Reschedule or cancel appointments within constraints

- Push notifications for approvals or rejections
