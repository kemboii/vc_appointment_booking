## Problem Statement
At the University of Eastern Africa, Baraton, booking appointments with the Vice Chancellor is currently handled manually. 
This may result in scheduling conflicts, missed communications, unclear records, and inefficiency in managing appointments.

Students, staff, and parents lack a reliable, structured method to view available time slots and book appointments. While the VC's office may struggle with the manual way of booking appointments and tracking of visitor information effectively.

## Proposed Solution
The Vc Appointment Booking App aims to digitize and simplify the appointment scheduling process. The solution will provide users with a clean interface to register, login and view available 15-minute time slots on Tuesdays

They can book appointments based on availability and receive confirmations instantly. For the secretary or administrator, the app provides tools to review bookings, view appointment details, and easily manage the VC's schedule.

## Objectives
1. To create a user friendly appplication for scheduling appointments with the VC.
2. To provide a dashboard for the VC's secretary to view appointments.
3. To implement secure login and authentication.
